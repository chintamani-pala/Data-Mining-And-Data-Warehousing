Frequent Patterns:
Frequent patterns refer to sets of items or attributes that frequently occur together in a dataset. It involves identifying combinations of items that appear together more often than others. For instance, in market basket analysis, frequent itemsets help identify commonly co-purchased items.

Association Rules:
Association rules express relationships between different items in a dataset. They typically consist of an antecedent (if) and a consequent (then). These rules aim to find strong connections between items or attributes. For instance, in retail, association rules might indicate that customers who buy product A are highly likely to buy product B as well.

Support, Confidence, and Lift:
Support: Indicates how frequently a pattern or rule appears in the dataset.
Confidence: Measures the reliability of the ruleâ€”how often the rule has been found to be true.
Lift: Reflects how much more likely items are to be bought together compared to what would be expected based on their individual support.
Importance in Data Mining:
Identifying frequent patterns and strong association rules is crucial in various fields:
Market basket analysis for retail recommendations.
Medical diagnosis for finding patterns in symptoms.
Web usage mining for understanding user behavior.
Fraud detection by recognizing unusual associations.
Implementation:
Algorithms like Apriori and FP-Growth are commonly used to discover frequent patterns and generate association rules.
These algorithms use support and confidence thresholds to filter patterns and rules.
